xlfly - separate GUI based Excel tools

I love xlwings! However, I have noticed it very difficult to handle heavy calculations if using user defined functions. Hence xlfly: making using UDF easier. I chose separate GUI so that I can run parallel threads easier. 

This package only works on Windows

Create Windows Start Menu Item:
>> xly --init

Excel selection to "Run Python"
1. Write python expressions in the cells
2. Select the cell with python scripts
3. Click "Run Python" button


I used the icon from https://www.iconfinder.com/search?q=wings&price=free drawn by Monsieur Steven Ankri. Thanks!
